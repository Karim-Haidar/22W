# New Shades for a New Generation

Artificial Intelligence equipped glasses are a new and innovative technology that is helping to improve the lives of the visually impaired. AI glasses are outfitted with a camera and software for image, object and text recognition, allowing people who are legally blind to “see” objects in their environment. The glasses can detect objects and relay information such as distance, size, and shape to the user. This technology is helping to increase the independence and mobility of the visually impaired, allowing them to visualize and navigate their environment with ease.

The glasses are equipped with a myriad of features that make them incredibly helpful for the visually impaired. They have an adjustable focus that can be adjusted to the individual’s needs, allowing them to see objects that may be too far away or too close for them to see normally. Additionally, the glasses are equipped with a voice assistant that supports a multitude of features such as provide directions, take phone calls, send text messages and surf the internet for them. This technology is allowing visually impaired people to live more independently and actively engage in their communities.
