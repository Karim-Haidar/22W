# New Shades for a New Generation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence equipped glasses are a new and innovative technology that is helping to improve the lives of the visually impaired. AI glasses are outfitted with a camera and software for image, object and text recognition, allowing people who are legally blind to “see” objects in their environment. The glasses can detect objects and relay information such as distance, size, and shape to the user. This technology is helping to increase the independence and mobility of the visually impaired, allowing them to visualize and navigate their environment with ease.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glasses are equipped with a myriad of features that make them incredibly helpful for the visually impaired. They have an adjustable focus that can be adjusted to the individual’s needs, allowing them to see objects that may be too far away or too close for them to see normally. Additionally, the glasses are equipped with a voice assistant that supports a multitude of features such as provide directions, take phone calls, send text messages and surf the internet for them. This technology is allowing visually impaired people to live more independently and actively engage in their communities.

AI glasses are not only helpful for the visually impaired, but they are also helping to advance medical research. By providing researchers with data on how the visually impaired interact with their environment, researchers can develop better treatments and therapies to help them. These glasses have a lot of room for improvement but their current capabilities show great promise for the future. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ehENnq2EFo">video</a> shows the current problems the glasses tackle.

# Shaping the Future with AI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many sectors realize the potential of AI and seek to incorporate and further the development of AI-based technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and autonomous robots. This technology is helping to make the world a more accessible place for everyone, especially to the disabled.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-driving Cars are now still in their infancy where the manufacturers recommend using the feature on highways only, however as the manufacturers fine-tune and train the AI it seems to be only a matter of time before visually impaired individuals could ride vehicles unattended. Though, the day we achieve “Level 4 autonomy” <a href="https://coolblindtech.com/when-will-self-driving-cars-be-ready-for-blind-and-visually-impaired-people/">(2)</a> has yet to come.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting venture is cleaning tasks which the visually impaired usually struggle with. Many products are readily available on the market mainly the Roomba <a href="https://www.irobot.de/de_DE/roomba.html">(3)</a> that has proven successful as a vacuum and mop along with other products such as the Alfawise magnetic windows cleaner <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Alfawise-Magnetic-Smartphone-Controlled-Ultra-Fast/dp/B07TCMKDHD">(4)</a>. While, the above products cover only a subset of house chores it certainly paves the way for more comprehensive solutions in the near future.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we’ve been using technology to take care of our chores, can it cook? The answer isn’t quite straightforward, while autonomous kitchens have been popping up in limited applications such as restaurants severing noodles in Japan <a href="https://www.aiplusinfo.com/blog/connected-robotics-robotic-kitchen-japan/#:~:text=A%20Japanese%20start%2Dup%20company,delicious%20kakiage%20all%20by%20itself.">(5)</a> and pizza in Los Angeles <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/02/robot-cooks-are-rapidly-making-their-way-into-restaurant-kitchens.html">(6)</a>, these robots are specialized. One Application that isn’t specialized is the Moley Kitchen robot <a href="https://www.moley.com/">(7)</a> and makes use of two robotic arms with pressure sensitive fingers, though as impressive as that sounds, the online videos posted by the company more than a year ago show that the robot isn’t “there” yet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1GVwbYURuQ">(8)</a>.
